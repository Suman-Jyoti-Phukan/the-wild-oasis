5 . Normal Behavior: By default, React Query will automatically refetch data when you navigate back to a component that uses a query if the data is considered stale based on the staleTime setting. This happens when you render the component again, switch between components, or switch between tabs.

Using invalidateQueries: When you use the invalidateQueries function, you're manually marking specific queries as stale, regardless of whether the staleTime has expired. This triggers an immediate refetch for those queries, even if you haven't navigated away and back to the component. It's a way to manually force a refetch without relying on the automatic stale check based on rendering or navigation.
